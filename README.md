This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.


## Data Analysis: 

### Pandas Series: 
- **A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.**


### Pandas DataFrames:
- **A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.**

>> Not: We can perform various numerical operations on pandas Series and DataFrames. 


- **We can read and save data from varius files formats.**
- **We can explore data.**
- **We can handle missing data, remove duplicates, and rename columns.**
- **We can select and filter data.**
- **We can group and aggregate data.**
- **We can calculate correlations between columns.**
- **We can create data cirtualization.**
